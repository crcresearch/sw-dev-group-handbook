# CRC Social Events

During the year we host and attend several social events.

## Yearly Events

### Summer Picnic
The Summer Picnic takes place in the late summer at St. Patrick's Park in one of the shelters. It's a great day of food and fun with summer games like sand volleyball, frisbee, etc. Families are encouraged to attend.

### Pi Day
We typically observe Pi Day (March 14) by bringing in different kinds of pies to enjoy in the afternoon. 

Pi Day 2017 was the first year we added Pie Throwing to the celebration as a fundraiser for Hope Ministries. Thanks to Dave Pettifor for creating this [video of the celebration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBzpqIFSVVc).

### March Madness
Each year, we do an NCAA Bracket Challenge within the CRC. Typically, [Paul Brenner](mailto:paul.r.brenner@nd.edu) coordinates the bracket challenge. Paul will send out an email before the tournament begins to invite all CRC members to participate. Everyone is welcome to participate and you don't need to know anything about basketball. 

### Football Fridays
On Fridays before home football games, the University hosts Football Fridays over between the Alumni Center and Hammes Bookstore. There is free popcorn, hot dogs for $1, and other food. They have speakers, music, and a photo booth with fun props. You can also go down the tunnel in the stadium or tour the Guglielmino Complex where the team practices. 

Typically we have a group that will walk over around lunch time for the food and sometimes a group photo.

More information on the traditions of Football Friday can be found [here](https://gameday.nd.edu/traditions/football-friday-traditions/).

### Thanksgiving Potluck
Around Thanksgiving, we usually have a potluck lunch. Everyone is encouraged to bring in a dish to celebrate Thanksgiving.

### Christmas

#### CRC Holiday Party
Every December, we have the CRC Christmas Party. This family event is typically held in the clubhouse at Warren Golf Course and consists of a nice dinner and maybe a visit from Santa!

#### NDR Christmas Party
Notre Dame Research also hosts a Christmas party after work one day in December. Drinks and appetizers are usually served.

#### President's Christmas Party
A University-wide Christmas celebration is held in the Main Building each year, as well. The Main Building is decorated with a tall Christmas tree underneath the dome and creches from various parts of the world are on display around it. In the wings on each of the 3 upper floors, there are different treats, appetizers, and festive drinks. 

## Other Events

### First Thursday
On the first Thursday of each month, we gather at one of the nearby restaurants for appetizers and drinks around 4:00 PM. Appetizers and non-alcoholic drinks are provided. This is a great opportunity to socialize outside of the work environment. Past First Thursdays have been held at Legends, Rohr's, O'Rourke's, and Brothers. 

[Laura Kresnak](mailto:Laura.K.Kresnak.2@nd.edu) coordinates First Thursdays and is open to suggestions about where to host it. 

### Game Night
We have recently begun holding game nights for the CRC. These are not on a regular basis currently, but can be scheduled as demand arises. We bring in whatever board games we have or are interested in playing. Family and friends are welcome to attend game night.

If you are interested in when a game night is next being scheduled, please contact [Caleb Reinking](mailto:Caleb.M.Reinking.2@nd.edu) or [Beth Calwell](mailto:ecaldwe1@nd.edu)

### Lunch Service at Hope Ministries
Every other month, on the second Tuesday of the month, we send a group of volunteers to help serve lunch at Hope Ministries in Downtown South Bend. The people Hope Ministries serves are always very appreciative and it is always a rewarding experience.

[Brett Fox](mailto:bfox6@nd.edu) is in charge of coordinating the Hope Ministries service. Any questions about this service opportunity can be directed to him. New volunteers are always welcome!
