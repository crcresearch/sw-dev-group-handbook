## Attendance
As full-time Exempt staff, we are expected to work 40 hour weeks.  
Within the CRC, we are pretty flexible on arrival time. Most developers arrive between 9:00 AM and 9:30 AM.  
Especially with our move to Scrum-based development, we are expected to be in the office for the majority of the work day unless time off has been approved. Individual scrum team agreements may have more specific attendance requirements if the team decides it is necessary.

### Absences
Below are the official University Policies on time off.

* [University holidays](http://hr.nd.edu/nd-faculty-staff/forms-policies/holidays/)
* [Sick Time](http://hr.nd.edu/nd-faculty-staff/forms-policies/sick-leave-salary-continuation-administrators/)
* [Vacation](http://hr.nd.edu/nd-faculty-staff/forms-policies/vacation---administrators/)

### Reporting Absences
Absences, whether vacation, personal days, or sick days, are logged in [My Time Off](http://mytimeoff.nd.edu). Vacations need to be requested in advance. A week in advance is preferable notice for vacation requests. Personal days do not need to be requested in advance and no questions will be asked. 

The Software Development Group also has an Out of Office Calendar that all of our absences should be recorded on. Caleb can add you to the group if you are not able to see the calendar. To add the calendar to your list of other calendars, paste this link in the box that says "Add a coworker's calendar": *nd.edu_t173rj035tct1picdgknco7phk@group.calendar.google.com*

## Redmine
### Timekeeping
Time is logged in Redmine.

[Redmine Time Logging](https://redmine.crc.nd.edu/reports/home/)

All time must be logged by the end of every week. It is easiest to log time on a daily basis. 

MyTimeOff-related absences should also be recorded in Redmine under the appropriate subproject of the MyTimeOff project in Redmine.

### Projects
Every project has a Redmine page. A project's Redmine space contains project management details such as budget, tasks, time spent, important milestones, and even a wiki space if desired.

## Version Control
### Git
The CRC uses [git](https://git-scm.com) to version control code. Git is the industry standard for versioning and distributing code. 

We generally employ a git branching model that is [gitflow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow)-ish and loosely resembles the pattern in the related [blog post](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).

### GitHub
The CRC's git projects are usually hosted on GitHub. The CRC has a GitHub organization called **crcresearch**. Alex is the administrator of this organization and can add you as a collaborator. Our academic organization status allows us to use unlimited private repositories within our team.

## Communication
### Google Group
There is a Google Group of all the people in the Software Development group. 

Information can be sent to everyone in this group through the [crc-ci-developers-group@nd.edu](mailto:crc-ci-developers-group@nd.edu ).  
Alternatively, you can add a new topic directly within the [CRC CI Developers](https://groups.google.com/a/nd.edu/forum/?hl=en#!forum/crc-ci-developers-group) group.

### Slack
The CRC uses Slack as its inter-office chat system.

Our team is **crc-nd**. You can join the team [here](https://slack.com/get-started#join) or through an invitation email sent when one of the admins adds you to the team. Currently, Rob Wieck and Caleb are admins for our organization

We have a  number of channels for different conversations.
You are required to join the #announcements channel.

Channels exist for the django and javascript stacks, so feel free to ask questions there.

The #jocularity_v3 and #random channels are for less work-related discussions.
Channels also exist for other interests, such as: sports, coffee, board games, eating lunch in the dining hall. 

Your scrum team may decide to create a channel for team discussion.

## Monday Dev Group Meetings
Every Monday at 1:00 PM, we have a software developer group meeting. 

This is a chance to share announcements, information, and ask questions. Usually we begin with a fun activity. Attendance is required unless you have a scheduled absence.
