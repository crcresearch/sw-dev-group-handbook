## Attendance
As full-time Exempt staff, we are expected to work 40 hour weeks.  
Within the CRC, we are pretty flexible on arrival time. Most developers arrive between 9:00 AM and 9:30 AM.  
Especially with our move to Scrum-based development, we are expected to be in the office for the majority of the work day unless time off has been approved. Individual scrum team agreements may have more specific attendance requirements if the team decides it is necessary.

### Absences
Below are the official University Policies on time off.

* [Vacation](http://hr.nd.edu/nd-faculty-staff/forms-policies/vacation---administrators/)

### Reporting Absences
Absences, whether vacation, personal days, or sick days, are logged in [My Time Off](http://mytimeoff.nd.edu). Vacations or personal days need to be requested in advance. 

The Software Development Group also has an Out of Office Calendar that all of our absences should be recorded on. Caleb can add you to the group if you are not able to see the calendar.

## Monday Dev Group Meetings
Every Monday at 1:00 PM, we have a software developer group meeting. This is a chance to share announcements, information, and ask questions. Usually we begin with a fun activity. Attendance is required unless you have a scheduled absence.
