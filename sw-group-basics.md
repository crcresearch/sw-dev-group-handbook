## Attendance
As full-time Exempt staff, we are expected to work 40 hour weeks.  
Within the CRC, we are pretty flexible on arrival time. Most developers arrive between 9:00 AM and 9:30 AM.  
Especially with our move to Scrum-based development, we are expected to be in the office for the majority of the work day unless time off has been approved. Individual scrum team agreements may have more specific attendance requirements if the team decides it is necessary.

### Absences
Below are the official University Policies on time off.

* [University holidays](http://hr.nd.edu/nd-faculty-staff/forms-policies/holidays/)
* [Sick Time](http://hr.nd.edu/nd-faculty-staff/forms-policies/sick-leave-salary-continuation-administrators/)
* [Vacation](http://hr.nd.edu/nd-faculty-staff/forms-policies/vacation---administrators/)

### Reporting Absences
Absences, whether vacation, personal days, or sick days, are logged in [My Time Off](http://mytimeoff.nd.edu). Vacations need to be requested in advance. A week in advance is preferable notice for vacation requests. Personal days do not need to be requested in advance and no questions will be asked. 

The Software Development Group also has an Out of Office Calendar that all of our absences should be recorded on. Caleb can add you to the group if you are not able to see the calendar. To add the calendar to your list of other calendars, paste this link in the box that says "Add a coworker's calendar": *nd.edu_t173rj035tct1picdgknco7phk@group.calendar.google.com*

## Redmine
### Timekeeping
Time is logged in Redmine.

[Redmine Time Logging Site](https://redmine.crc.nd.edu/reports/home/)

All time must be logged by the end of every week. It is easiest to log time on a daily basis. 

Time is entered on the Entries page. Redmine also provides a calendar view and a pie chart view depicting the time distribution between projects.

To enter your time:
* Select the Project or other category that the item is billed to in the leftmost dropdown. 
* Make sure you are entering time for the correct date. If you enter your time daily, this will default to the current day and you won't have any problems.
* Time should be entered in a minimum of half hour increments. 
* Comments allow you to describe your task(s). 
* Issue # allows you to enter a Redmine ticket number to link the time to that ticket. 
* Most time for Software Developers will be spent as Development. 
* The Log As column should typically say Programming(internal). 

### Projects
Every project has a Redmine page. 

[Redmine Projects](https://redmine.crc.nd.edu/redmine/projects/)
 
Each Project will have tickets under the Issues tab. These are assigned to individuals. The Roadmap tab will show how the project is progressing. There is also the option to have a wiki to record project information. 

### Best Practices
The [Best Practices for Software Engineering](https://redmine.crc.nd.edu/redmine/projects/bestpractice) page is located in Redmine.

### SkillsMatrix
[SkillsMatrix]() is an application that allows us to keep track of what skills our developers know. Each developer has an account and can add their skills and skill levels to their profile. We can also search by skill, so  if you need help with a certain aspect of a project, you can look up who is familiar with that technology to ask questions or get advice.

## Goals and Endeavor
The University uses an online talent management system called Endeavor. Endeavor provides electronic tools to register for and track learning programs and conduct the performance management process for staff.

Endeavor can be accessed at [endeavor.nd.edu](https://endeavor.nd.edu) or through the Endeavor app on [InsideND](https://inside.nd.edu). 

More information on Endeavor can be found [here](http://hr.nd.edu/career-development/endeavor/).

### Learning Management Tool
 Endeavor lists courses available through Human Resources, the Office of Information Technology (OIT), and the Office of Continuous Improvement. You can register for courses through the system. Discuss taking a course with your supervisor.

### Performance Management Tool
Staff uses Endeavor to set annual goals and enter mid-year and year-end comments and ratings. You and your supervisor will discuss what goals make sense for you. 

The annual Performace Management cycle basically fits in the academic year. We typically set our goals in July, do mid-year reviews around November, and end-of-year reviews in May. These reviews are held with your supervisor and will factor into your yearly rating. 

Performance is evaluated on both goals and values. In addition to our own personal goals, we are also expected to work towards the University's goals and uphold the University's values. Information on the goals and values of the University can be found here: [Mission, Goals, & Values](http://hr.nd.edu/why-nd/university-goals-values/).

The values and rating levels are explained in a [document provided by Human Resources](http://hr.nd.edu/assets/83570/universityvalueslevelsrev2012.pdf).

More information on Performance Management can be found [here](http://hr.nd.edu/career-development/performance-management/performance-management/).

## Communication
### Google Group
There is a Google Group of all the people in the Software Development group. 

Information can be sent to everyone in this group through the [crc-ci-developers-group@nd.edu](mailto:crc-ci-developers-group@nd.edu ).  
Alternatively, you can add a new topic directly within the [CRC CI Developers](https://groups.google.com/a/nd.edu/forum/?hl=en#!forum/crc-ci-developers-group) group.

### Slack
The CRC uses Slack as its inter-office chat system.

Our team is **crc-nd**. You can join the team [here](https://slack.com/get-started#join) or through an invitation email sent when one of the admins adds you to the team. Currently, Rob Wieck and Caleb are admins for our organization

We have a  number of channels for different conversations.
You are required to join the #announcements channel.

Channels exist for the django and javascript stacks, so feel free to ask questions there.

The #jocularity_v3 and #random channels are for less work-related discussions.
Channels also exist for other interests, such as: sports, coffee, board games, eating lunch in the dining hall. 

Your scrum team may decide to create a channel for team discussion.

## Version Control
### Git
The CRC uses [git](https://git-scm.com) to version control code. Git is the industry standard for versioning and distributing code. 

We generally employ a git branching model that is [gitflow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow)-ish and loosely resembles the pattern in the related [blog post](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).

### GitHub
The CRC's git projects are usually hosted on GitHub. The CRC has a GitHub organization called **crcresearch**. Alex is the administrator of this organization and can add you as a collaborator. Our academic organization status allows us to use unlimited private repositories within our team.

## Monday Dev Group Meetings
Every Monday at 1:00 PM, we have a software developer group meeting. 

This is a chance to share announcements, information, and ask questions. Usually we begin with a fun activity. Attendance is required unless you have a scheduled absence.
