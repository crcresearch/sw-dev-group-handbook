## Work Related Events
Breakfast items are provided every Monday morning in the ITC 111 Conference Room.

### CRC All Hands Meetings
We've been having monthly All-Hands Breakfast meetings in the morning where the entire CRC/CSR is together for announcements. We also have an All-Hands meeting in the dining hall about twice a year. All-Hands meetings are mandatory attendance. Sickness is excused and for the breakfast meetings, if you have a conflict you must let your manager and Jarek know.

### NDR All Hands Meetings
Every year there is a Notre Dame Research All Hands Meeting that we are invited to. If you've looked at the [Organizational Structure](), you know that the CRC is within the Notre Dame Research Department. This is an opportunity to celebrate the accomplishments within the department and hear about upcoming plans.

### Lunch and Learn
Lunch and Learn, when scheduled, take place on Mondays during lunch time. These meetings provide a forum for anyone to present new technologies, interesting ideas, or information that is relevant to us as developers. Lunch and Learns are not scheduled regularly, but if you have an interest in presenting during one, please talk to Caleb.

## Mailboxes
Everyone has a mailbox in the CRC.  
Mailboxes are located in the ITC 111 Conference Room. Names are on the left side of the mailbox.

## First Aid
There is a first aid kit located at Marcy's desk.  
You can also go to the [Wellness Center](http://wellnesscenter.nd.edu)

## Dress Code
The University expects employees to be clean, neat, and dressed appropriately for their job. It is important to remember that we represent the University when interacting with students, other employees, and visitors.

### CRC Academic Year Dress Code
During the academic year, we are expected to dress in business casual. This is especially important when attending meetings with clients, since we want to represent the University and the department well. Jeans can be worn sparingly, but they must be free of holes.
 
### CRC Summer Dress Code
During the summer, things are much more relaxed. The University allows employees to dress more casually. Jeans can be worn more frequently. 

Typically, in the CRC, we are allowed to wear shorts during the summer. This will be communicated to the group by management. Shorts must be a workplace appropriate length.

Flip flops and sport sandals are not permitted at any time.


## Communication
### Zoom
The University uses Zoom as its preferred service for audio & video conferencing. 

Zoom integrates with Google Calendar, so you can schedule a Zoom meeting easily. To schedule a Zoom meeting, you will need to create an account which will require your Notre Dame NetID. You do not need an account to join a meeting.

[Access Zoom](https://notredame.zoom.us/)

## Technology
### Networks
There are two wireless networks available on campus.
 
* eduroam: The on-campus secure wireless network for students, faculty, staff, and affiliates in eduroam. 
* ND-guest: Wireless network for visitors and guests

Wired network connections are available in nearly all campus buildings. To use the wired network, you will need to enter your Notre Dame NetID and password.

### VPN
If you are off campus, you can connect to the Campus VPN. Several sites will require you to be physically on campus or use the VPN for access.

[Use the ND VPN](https://vpnaccess.nd.edu/+CSCOE+/logon.html)

### Printing
For work-related printing, you can use the Canon printer in the hallway outside of ITC 111.
Instructions for setting up this printer can be found on the [CRC Staff Pages](https://crc.nd.edu/index.php/aboutcrc/crc-staff).
Mac and Windows instructions are provided.

There is also a printer in the Software Developers room (ITC 123). The IP Address for this printer is 172.17.132.254. It is an HP LaserJet P2055dn. You will need to install drivers for it as well most likely.

For other printing, PrintND allows you to submit a job to the system and print it from any computer lab printer. You will need to [install the PrintND drivers](https://oit.nd.edu/services/software/software-downloads/printnd-print-drivers/) to use this service. Additionally, each page will be deducted from your print quota.

### Software
Notre Dame makes many software titles available for use across campus. Below you will find information about how to obtain licensed software, and in some cases, a download of certain titles. Many of the downloads are password protected and blocked to networks outside Notre Dame to enforce licensing agreements.

[Software Downloads](https://oit.nd.edu/services/software/software-downloads/) (requires NetID and password)

You can also purchase some software for personal or university use at a discount. More information [here](https://nd.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0011317).

### Collaboration and File Storage
The University provides access to Google Drive and [Box](https://notredame.app.box.com) for file storage. Using your NetID and password, you should have free, unlimited use of each of those for file storage. 

Keep in mind that if your project is working with very sensitive data, it is not a good idea to save that information in these locations.
