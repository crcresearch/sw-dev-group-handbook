Mailboxes are located in the ITC 111 Conference Room. Names are on the left side of the mailbox.

There is a first aid kit located at Marcy's desk.

## Dress Code
The University expects employees to be clean, neat, and dressed appropriately for their job. It is important to remember that we represent the University when interacting with students, other employees, and visitors.

### CRC Dress Code
#### School Year Dress Code
During the academic year, we are expected to dress in business casual. This is especially important when attending meetings with clients, since we want to represent the University and the department well. Jeans can be worn sparingly, but they must be free of holes.
 
#### Summer Dress Code
During the summer, things are much more relaxed. The University allows employees to dress more casually. Jeans can be worn more frequently. 

Typically, in the CRC, we are allowed to wear shorts during the summer. This will be communicated to the group by management. Shorts must be a workplace appropriate length.

Flip flops and sport sandals are not permitted at any time.
