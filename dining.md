### Faculty & Staff Meal Plans
It is possible for Staff members to add a meal plan to their account. You will be able to swipe your ID card in the Dining Hall for meals.

There are 3 options for meal plans. You can buy a block of 10 meals, 20 meals, or 5 Value Lunches.

The 10 or 20 meal plans allow you to use your meals for coworkers, colleagues, family members, or other guests. The value lunches plan is non-transferable.

Eating in the dining hall without a meal plan will cost you around $14. If that is something you are interested in doing from time to time, then a meal plan can help you save some money.
