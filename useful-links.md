# A list of useful info
####in no particular order...
* [Interactive Campus Map](https://m.nd.edu/notredame/map/)
* [Dome Cam](dome.nd.edu)
    * Video feed from the dome. Nice way to check the weather if you are trapped in a room with no windows!
    * Also has some cool photos of the inside of the dome.
* [SurplusND](http://http://surplus.nd.edu/shop-ndsurplus/)
    * good for finding cheap additional monitors for home or random furniture
* [ND Outlet Store](https://www.follett.com/bookstores-directions.cfm?storeid=70-1541)
    * The Notre Dame Clearance Center is located at 1610 N. Ironwood Drive in South Bend and is a discount retail store for ND apparel, collectibles, and gifts that is open between football seasons. And as a bonus, if youâ€™re eligible for a staff discount at the Bookstore, you can use the same discount at the Clearance Center on top of the already great savings.
* [Game Day Parking](https://gameday.nd.edu/campus/parking/)
    * Parking for Faculty & Staff with a valid permit is FREE in the White Field Lots. 
    * ADA parking is also available for Faculty & Staff with a valid permit and an accessible hangtag or license plate in the Bulla Lot off of Bulla Avenue. 
    * There are shuttles that run from the White Field Lots to Hesburgh Library before and after the game. Wait time before the game is not typically long, however after the game it is much faster to walk to your car if possible.
